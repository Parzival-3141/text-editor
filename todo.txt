File browser
 - file saving/loading
 - fuzzy search node by name
    - move cursor to first match, press a button to cycle between matches.
    - press enter to open node, escape to cancel

Make camera context aware, zooming in/out to frame text better, and loosely following the cursor

Write StringBuilder library to avoid C strings
 - Pointer and a length
 - Write helper functions like append, concat, resize, etc.

Figure out why fs.zig hangs when compiling/analyzing cImports using -Doptimize=ReleaseFast

Cache inputs at start of frame, so I can query at any point in the code afterward
e.g. if (Input_get_key_down('K')) {...}


Clean up text rendering code
 - group things neat and consisely

Utilize screenspace coords and GL projection to cull geometry
 - When rendering text, we check if the resulting quad's bounding box is within the screen range.
	If it isn't, we skip rendering the quad and just advance the "pen". 

 - After projection GL will handle any triangles that are partially offscreen, and cull ones that 
	arent visible entirely.

CLI
 - open file/directory at a given path
 - start a new buffer if no path argument is given
