File browser
 - file saving/loading

Write StringBuilder library
 - Pointer and a length
 - Write helper functions like append, concat, resize, etc.

Figure out why fs.zig hangs when compiling cImports using -Doptimize=ReleaseFast

Cache inputs at start of frame, so I can query at any point in the code afterward
e.g. if (Input_get_key_down('K')) {...}

Clean up text rendering code
 - group things neat and consisely

Utilize screenspace coords and GL projection to cull geometry
 - When rendering text, we check if the resulting quad's bounding box is within the screen range.
	If it isn't, we skip rendering the quad and just advance the "pen". 

 - After projection GL will handle any triangles that are partially offscreen, and cull ones that 
	arent visible entirely.
