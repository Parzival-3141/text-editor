Ability to open/close text-edit box




Clean up text rendering code
 - Render the cursor in a more correct fashion, see freetype docs
 - group things neat and consisely

Utilize screenspace coords and GL projection to cull geometry
 - When rendering text, we check if the resulting quad's bounding box is within the screen range.
	If it isn't, we skip rendering the quad and just advance the "pen". 

 - After projection GL will handle any triangles that are partially offscreen, and cull ones that 
	arent visible entirely.


Write String type
 - Pointer and a length
 - Write some helper functions like init(?), concat, resize
